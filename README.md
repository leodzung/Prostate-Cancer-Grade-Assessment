# Prostate Cancer Grade Assessment

## Overview
Prostate Cancer is causing 1 million new diagnoses and 350,000 deaths annually. More precise diagnostics is key to decrease the mortality rate. Prostate tissue biopsies are graded in Gleason patterns based on the growth pattern of the tumor, and then converted into an ISUP grade from 1 to 5. This score is then used to decide the treatment for the patient. A more precise grading system will help to avoid both the risk of missing cancers and of unnecessary treatment.
